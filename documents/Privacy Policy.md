# PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated:** `24.07.2024`

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in using Rexus. Before proceeding, please carefully read, understand, and accept the Terms of Service of Rexus, followed by this Privacy Policy.

Your privacy is of utmost importance to me. I do not sell or disclose any of your data to third parties. This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is collected, used, and protected.

To enhance the services provided by Rexus, I may utilize certain public information you provide. This includes, but is not limited to, your Discord account ID, username, avatar, and the guilds you joined to. For detailed information regarding data usage and storage, please refer to the sections below.

## Use of the Rexus app within Discord
By using Rexus, you grant permission to xRedCrystalx (the developer) and designated application administrators (trusted individuals) to access and process all information within your guild that Rexus has access to. This access is used for purposes including, but not limited to, identifying and resolving issues, providing support, and ensuring seamless operation in collaboration with the guild's owner and administrators.

### 1. User information
1. **Stored information in database:**
    - Identifier (User ID)
    - User specific information (includes user app configuration, premium/supporter status, app role etc.)
    - Guild specific logs (including but not limited to moderation logs, notes etc.)

    This information is retained for purposes of verification and accountability.

2. **Cached information:**

    All data provided by Discord in JSON format is temporarily cached to support the application's protection algorithms.
    
    **This includes:**
    - Discord account names (global, display, account, nickname)
    - Identifier (User ID)
    - Avatar & banner (Avatar & banner image as URL, this also includes avatar decorations)
    - Creation date & guild join dates
    - Guild specific information (Mutual guilds, roles, nickname)
    - Status and activities (current status and activitiy, including the client being used (web, phone, desktop))

3. **Private information:**
    
    No private information such as full names, billing addresses, goverment-issued IDs, or phone numbers is stored. The information referenced in points 1 and 2 is either publicly available or accessible to authorized individuals (such as xRedCrystalx and app administrators) and guild-specific moderators/administrators.

### 2. Guild information
To ensure the proper functionality of Rexus, the application will request `Administrator` permissions and recommend (though not require) positioning its role as high as possible in the guild's role hierarchy. This ensures the application can moderate the guild effectively without permission-related disruptions.

With `Administrator` permissions, the application gains substantial control over the guild. The following information will be stored:
1. **Stored information in database:**
    - Identifier (Guild ID)
    - Plugin/Module specific configuration (including but not limited to channel IDs, role IDs, user IDs, automod rule IDs etc.)

2. **Cached information:**

    All data provided by Discord in JSON format is temporarily cached to support the application's protection algorithms and recommendations.
    
    **This includes:**
    - General guild information (name, ID, description, banner, premium tier...)
    - Guild structure, default channels & its configurations (categories, channels, threads, forums...)
    - Roles, permissions & administrators
    - Security information (mfa level, verification level, automod, filters...)
    - Guild users (count, currently active...)
    - Emojis, stickers & events

    This information is not logged unless explicitly enabled by the guild owner and/or administrators.

### 3. Messages
Rexus may access all newly created messages in your server and cache the last 100 messages for each channel. This caching is done to provide sufficient data for chat/text algorithms and automated moderation to yield more accurate results.

App does not store or log any message contents unless:
1. **Explicitly Enabled in the Configuration:** Such as "Log deleted messages" if they were in the cache.
2. **Moderator/Administrator Action:** When a moderator or administrator replies to a message with a moderation command (e.g., warn) as proof of the action taken.
3. **Violation of Discord's ToS & Privacy Policy or Law:** When message content could potentially violate Discord's Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or applicable laws, in which case it will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities.

App does not store or log any message attachments unless:
1. **Explicitly Enabled in the Configuration:** Such as "Attachment moderation" if they were in the cache, including:
    - Scan possibly harmful attachments
    - Compare attachment's hash value with known viruses
2. **Harmful, Inappropriate, or Unlawful Attachments:** Which will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities.

### 4. Specific plugins
Certain Rexus plugins require specific data to function effectively. This includes, but is not limited to, message content, attachments, and automod reports.

For example:
- Chat filter
- Virus scanner
- Auto moderation actions

Some Rexus plugins operate globally, meaning that algorithms are designed to protect against current threats and events.
For example:

- Scam protection

Data will not be utilized until the guild owner or administrators enable and configure the specific plugin. This applies to both global and guild-only plugins.

### 5. Artificial Intelligence
Currently, Rexus does not employ any form of artificial intelligence (AI). However, this may change in the future as the application evolves.

All detections and protections are managed by complex, non-AI algorithms, which have been thoroughly tested and optimized by humans.

## Security
All databases utilized to provide Rexus's services are strictly inaccessible to the public.

While I employ robust measures to protect your information, it is important to understand that no method of electronic transmission or storage is entirely secure, and absolute data security cannot be guaranteed.

Consequently, I cannot be held liable for any data loss or breaches.
